# streakzy-APP (Ecommerce Application)

I have created a shopping Application utilizing the following three technologies:
1. Flutter and Dart.
2. Firebase for the Backend.
3. GetX for state management.

This is my first Flutter App of my career which i have built in 10 days. I followed the readme provided by Sir Anshuman das and i followed a 
youtube channel i.e "coding with T" www.youtube.com/@CodingwithT for reference.

As my first flutter project, my learning process began with:
    1. Dart Syntax and basic programming.
    2. Learning about flutter Widgets.
    3. Had a project based learning.
    4. Integrated the project to the codebase.
    5. For more references, i also referred Stack Overflow and used the help of ChatGpt for some parts to learn more.

**Flow of the Project:**

- Once installed the app, the user can witness a Splash Screen.
- When he uses the app for the first time, he will notice a onboarding Screen, which has details about Streakzy and also has animations.
- If the user is a new user then only onboarding screen will appear else it wont.
- After the onboarding process, a sign up screen appears where the user has to enter his details to create a new account.
- The user can also create account using Google Sign in.
- if the user didn't enter all the fields correctly, the validation notices will be shown.
- if the user does not accept terms and conditions, he is not allowed to create account.
- Once Entering all the details correctly, the user will be redirected to a verify email page.
- The user needs to verify his email and after verification the app will automatically redirect to the home screen.
- The user can also reset his password if forgot, firebase will send a reset email link to the users email.
- Currently in the home screen only the user interface is ready and the backend needs to be updated which i will update as soon as possible.
- Store and Wishlist pages need to be completed and will be completed as soon as possible.
- I have created a profile screen, which consist the details about the user.
- This app also has a logout button, which will logout the user from the app.
- This is the video link of my created app. https://youtu.be/LdbmzCtcY24

**Modules:**
- Signup.
- Login.
- Validation of empty fields and values.
- Same user cannot register twice.
- Google Authentication.
- Dark Mode and Light Mode as per the users device preference.
- Remember me. (Password and email stored in the users local storage).
- User Friendly user interface.
- Refactored and created separate widgets to reuse in the code.

**To be Completed in the coming days:**
- Store Page.
- Favourite Page.
- Cart Modules and CRUD Operations.
- Integrate backend to the pending pages.
- Testing of the App.


Building this App has made me face a lot of challenges and learn a lot of new things, this challenge has motivated me and has given me a boost to start with new projects in the 
coming days. This project challenge has taught me the power of consistency and it has developed my knowledge and problem solving skills.
